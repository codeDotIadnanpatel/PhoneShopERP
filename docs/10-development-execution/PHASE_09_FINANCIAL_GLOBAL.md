- [ ] Implement domain/application behaviour and persistence/API contract as applicable.
- [ ] Add authorization, audit and validation.
- [ ] Add automated tests and update documentation/traceability.

### `P09-W07-T01` — Add multi-entity consolidation and advanced controls only after boundaries are proven.

- [ ] Clarify acceptance examples and edge cases.
- [ ] Implement domain/application behaviour and persistence/API contract as applicable.
- [ ] Add authorization, audit and validation.
- [ ] Add automated tests and update documentation/traceability.

## Non-negotiable phase rules

- Do not claim global compliance from generic configuration.
- Each jurisdiction pack requires documented rules, tests and appropriate local review.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] AP/AR balances reconcile to GL control accounts.
- [ ] Bank reconciliation is auditable and repeatable.
- [ ] Each jurisdiction pack has documented sources, scenarios and appropriate local review.

## Verification checklist

- [ ] Unit tests for domain rules and state transitions.
- [ ] Integration tests for persistence, transactions and migrations.
- [ ] API/contract tests for success and error cases.
- [ ] Authorization and cross-tenant negative tests.
- [ ] Duplicate/retry/idempotency and concurrency tests where applicable.
- [ ] Offline/reconnect/conflict tests where applicable.
- [ ] End-to-end demonstration of critical user journeys.

## Exit gate

All in-scope acceptance criteria must pass; critical defects must be closed or formally accepted; deliverables and evidence must be reviewed; update `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` and `REQUIREMENTS_TRACEABILITY.md`.

## AI-agent execution brief

Read `AGENTS.md`, this phase, the relevant functional specification and applicable architecture/security/offline/accounting documents before editing. Inspect existing code. Work only on assigned task IDs. State module, schema, API, permission, accounting, audit and offline impacts. Implement the smallest coherent change, add relevant tests, run checks, update documentation and report files changed, migrations, test results, limitations and unresolved decisions. Never hardcode tenant IDs, invent business rules, silently change architecture or claim completion without evidence.
